> DOM Events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place. Each event is represented by an object which is based on the Event interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions used to get additional information about what happened. Events can represent everything from basic user interactions to automated notifications of things happening in the rendering model.

Pick a written post from your theme website, and a [DOM event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) (anything but 'click') that you would like to explore using in Javascript. Design your theme post using interactions with the DOM event of your choice to support, alter, or display the post's content.

How can this interaction method express a creative idea? How is the communication of that idea altered via interactivity?
