Create a Favicon for your class website

- Open the default `favicon.ico` file from the class boilerplate, or create a new 32px × 32px composition with transparency in Photoshop.
- Create the image for your favicon.
  ![](/files/favicon-1.png)
- When saving the PNG file, change the file's extension from `.png` to `.ico` to overwrite the favicon file.
  ![](/files/favicon-2.png)

The favicon file must...

1. Be a 32px × 32px png image
2. Have the name `favicon.ico`
3. Be located at the **root** of your website
