Build a composition that includes at least 2 breakpoints/ media queries and uses the viewport width/height as a central method of interaction. How can resizing the window, as an interaction method, express a creative idea? How is the communication of that idea altered when viewed on different devices?

*Checkin Week 6 with concept + static design / mockup*

## Common Breakpoints

~~~
320px (small mobile device), 
480px (medium mobile device), 
768px (tablet), 
992px (small desktop), 
1200px (large desktop)
~~~

### Setting The Scale For Mobile Using Meta Tags

Add this tag to the `head` in your document to prevent your page from auto-scaling on mobile / retina devices.
~~~
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
