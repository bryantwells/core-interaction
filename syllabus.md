## Studio
We will exercise thinking and communication individually and as a group. We will use the course material, and our own thinking patterns as the foundation for building our respective practices

## Lab  
This course serves as a complement to Core Studio Interaction. The assignments are built to work in tandem with the projects students are developing in the studio class. The lab is designed around a series of small workshops that teach beginning and intermediate interaction design through a hands-on engagement with HTML and CSS.
