### Part 1

Break into groups of 3 – and help each other write your bio, and describe what you do.

Start by explaining your background to each other, verbally, then focus on one participant at a time. Each person writing key points that should be mentioned. The result would be a bullet list (3 – 5 items).

Then write one paragraph – minimum of 3 sentences for that person.

Repeat for each member. A cycle like that should take 15 minutes.
