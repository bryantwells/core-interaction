Break into groups of 2, and ask for feedback on the work you have done on your final project so far.

### Asking for feedback

Ask for specific feedback, be narrow and help the other person be constructive.

For example:

- what do you think of my topics frame?
- is the writing relatable?
- is the page layout too abstract?

### Giving Feedback

> How to compose a successful critical commentary:

> - You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.
> - You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
> - You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
> - Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.
