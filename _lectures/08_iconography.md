We will break into 2 groups. Each person should take something out of their bag and put it in on a communal table (objects like laptop, phone, comb, charger, sunglasses etc).

Once done each person should pick an object and draw an icon for it. You would need to present your idea, design and execution to the whole group.

Once everyone signs off and agrees on the designs, you would need to prep your files and upload your icons as custom emojis for our Slack group.

You can more info on [this article](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206870177-Create-custom-emoji).

Note that: _Square images work best. Image can't be larger than 128px in width or height, and must be smaller than 64K in file size_ (via the link above).


Bonus points if you can conduct a conversation using nothing but your emojis.
