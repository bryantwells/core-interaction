### Exercise

You will be split into groups of 4. You will need to design a blog for a dead artist, musician, poet, or otherwise public figure.

Spec's:

- one page
- copy
	- about
	- single post
- media
	- at least 1 image, or video
- header, footer
	- no need to worry about a logo


You will need to come up with one design and animate **4 gestures** in the site.

It is ok, and encouraged to combine different tools. You can achieve that by coming up with one static design, and splitting prototyping responsibility.


Kudos for using a collaborative design tool, and for coming up with code driven animations which could be reused later.
